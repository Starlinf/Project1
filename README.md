# Project 1 Impact of Covid 19 on Consumer Spendings
Team Members:  Evelisa Flores, Felipe Starling, Keiyau Sin

Project Descriptions: Our project is to understand how did COVID-19 affect consumer spending in the USA. We’ll be analyzing the consumer behavior to identify trends by industry, unemployment rates, payment methods and more.

Hypothesis: COVID-19 did have a negative impact on consumer spending.

Research Questions to Answer:
1. How consumer spending of different industries has changed and if certain industries were particularly hit hard by COVID-19?
2. What is the relationship between unemployment insurance benefits claims and consumer spending trends since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States?
3. Is there a COVID-19 impact differential in credit/debit card spending between consumer income classes?

Rough Breakdown of Task:
1. Research Data
2. Select Project Objective
3. Create Proposal
4. Create Repository
5. Data Gathering and Cleaning (EVE)
    * Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
    * Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
6. Data Analysis and Graphics
    * Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
        * aggregation
        * correlation
        * comparison
        * summary statistics
        * sentiment analysis
        * time series analysis
    * Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
    * Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
    * Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
7. Conclusions
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
