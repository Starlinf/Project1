# Project 1 Impact of Covid 19 on Consumer Spendings
Team Members:  Evelisa Flores, Felipe Starling, Keiyau Sin

Project Descriptions: Our project is to understand how did COVID-19 affect consumer spending in the USA. Weâ€™ll be analyzing the consumer behavior to identify trends by industry, unemployment rates and payment methods

Hypothesis: 
1. Ho - COVID-19 did not have a negative impact on consumer spending.
2. Ha - COVID-19 did have a negative impact on consumer spending.

Research Questions to Answer:
1. How consumer spending of different industries has changed and if certain industries were particularly hit hard by COVID-19?
2. What is the relationship between unemployment insurance benefits claims and consumer spending trends since the onset of COVID-19 in the United States?
3. Is there a COVID-19 impact differential in credit/debit card spending between consumer income classes?

Breakdown of Task:
1. Research Data
3. Create Proposal
4. Create Repository
5. Data Gathering and Cleaning
    * Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
    * Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process
6. Data Analysis and Graphics
    * Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis
        * Aggregation
        * Correlation
        * Comparison
        * Summary Statistics
        * Normality Test
        * Time Series Analysis
    * Use Matplotlib to visualize our data and analysis.
7. Conclusions
    * Reject Ho: COVID-19 cases did not have negative impact on consumer spending
    * Consumer spending and COVID-19 cases show a moderate negative relationship
    * Grocery and Food Industry is the only industry with increased spending during the analyzed period
    * All other industries show a significant drop in spending, and have not returned to pre-COVID level by the end of analyzed period
    * UI claims have increased and remained at a high level but its relationship with consumer spending is not conclusive
    * COVID-19 has a bigger impact on consumer spending within the high-income group however the relationships between the two is moderate.
